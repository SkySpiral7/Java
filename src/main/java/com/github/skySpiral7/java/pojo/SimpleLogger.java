/**
 * <p>This class is a very simple logger. It is useful for quick and dirty debugging.
 * For example if you need to debug a loop that will iterate 10,000 times but you
 * don't want to pollute the log file normally used then you can use this for a quick
 * temporary log. Or maybe in a loop if you want to track multiple things you can put
 * them each in their own log so you can see how they change over time without having
 * to parse which line belongs to which variable.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is final to make it perform faster. This class should not gain functionality
 * and should not be a method parameter or class field. This is because this class is intended for quick debugging
 * and should not be used in production (or other environments like QA) for that see a real logger like Log4J 2.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that all exceptions thrown by this class are unchecked in order to simplify the intended use case.</p>
