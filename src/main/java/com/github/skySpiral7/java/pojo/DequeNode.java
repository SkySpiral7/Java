/**
 * <p>This is mutable class for the nodes of a Deque. It keeps itself linked together but is not thread safe.
 * Nodes can be created with constructors or the factory.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note the scope and purpose of this class. This is a deque's node but not the {@link LinkedList deque itself}.
 * These are simple nodes without much functionality. Therefore a minimum number of public methods are provided
 * for a deque implementation. This is not designed for a tree or graph but a list: this is designed as a node
 * with previous node and next node pointers (and data) to be arranged in a line. This is not designed for complicated
 * insertions or sorting.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class's self linking nature should prevent pointer mismatch for linear structures.
 * This class does not validate pointers or detect structure shape.
 * Although not supported other shapes are possible (for example a circle should function mostly correctly).</p>
 *
 * @param <E> the data type to be stored
 *
 * @see Factory
 * @see DequeNodeIterator
 * @see LinkedList My Linked List which uses these nodes
